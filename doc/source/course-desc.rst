Description
===========

A recommender system (RS) can help to influence your customers’
behaviour directly but entertainingly. In this course, we will build
RS’s using different approaches: content-based, collaborative
filtering, context-aware, or a hybrid one. We will learn about the
theory behind diverse mathematical models of an RS task: matrix and
tensor decompositions, associative rules, neighbourhood methods,
learning to rank, and metric learning. For the practical part, we
will employ classical machine learning (such as ``scikit-learn``),
deep learning (e.g. ``pytorch``), and a slew of specialised packages
(``implicit`` amongs them). During the lectures, we
will talk not only about theorems but also about applications of RS’s
making the clients of companies and non-profit organisations happier.
No prior knowledge of the subject is necessary. Python programming
experience is mandatory. Statistical learning fundamentals will be
nice to have.
