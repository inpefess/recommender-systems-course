# Use previous pipeline

* MovieLens 25M dataset
* 95/5 train/test split by timestamp
* evaluate Hit-rate@10

# Factorisations Machines from Turi

* train a basic model (no side information)
* train a model with item side-information

# How to improve

* `turi` has plenty of parameters one can play with
* use `LibFM` or `libffm` instead
